The architectural design pattern for parallel programming called geometric decomposition helped us to reach the results we expected, reducing times by 52.28% for file 1 using 3 cores, and reduce by 28.20% for file 2 using 7 cores, these experiments help us satisfy most of quality attributes and avoid trade-offs that at first glance may seem impossible and at the same time satisfy most of the functional requirements

It is important to highlight that the choice of the K factor is based on the one that offers the best compression, but when we choose a K factor very far from its consecutive one using large files perhaps the parallelism may degrade the performance. Sometimes it is a good decision to add some noise to the original message since this way you can get closer K factors, and this would be another topic of research.
